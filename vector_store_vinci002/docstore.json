Consume 15g of fast-acting carbohydrates, such as half a can of soft drink (e.g. Original Coca Cola) or half a glass of fruit juice. Then, have 15 minutes of rest. Afterwards, maintain your blood glucose level by consuming 15g of long-acting carbohydrates, such as 1 slice of bread or 3 pieces of plain biscuits.

A glucometer is small and can be used at home, in clinics and health centres to aid in diabetes detection. The blood glucose test is a similar finger-prick test to indicate blood glucose level at that point in time. It is convenient and can be accurate if done properly. Anyone, even a child, can be taught to perform the test and it is essential for a person with diabetes to operate the glucometer. Another way is to take the HbA1c (haemoglobin A1c) test, which reflects average blood glucose control for a three-month period. Haemoglobin A1c in the red blood cells (glycohemoglobin) are glycated or sugar coated. The body usually replaces red blood cells every three months. This is usually done quarterly in the laboratory. The blood glucose and HbA1c tests are not universally accepted as diagnostic tests for diabetes mellitus.

Hence, it is important to seek prompt medical treatment if you see \u2018floaters', \u2018curtain falling' or something unusual happening to your vision.\nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine.\n", "doc_id": "35a199a9-ec08-4983-b042-83c053026717", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "bdc1f5b6368b25c0d0c610acfc1c935e700a7552f94018baa71735112bcc9f84", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 678}, "relationships": {"1": "637f34ba-8558-447c-be26-3a6ca0b01720"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "70b4dc02-b3ce-4836-a8c3-c43fd97766ec": {"__data__": {"text": "question: What is HbA1c?\nanswer: HbA1c stands for haemoglobin A1c or glycated haemoglobin, which is haemoglobin to which glucose is bound.

Carbs and sugar get broken down into glucose. A high-carb, high-sugar diet means we need more insulin to process all that glucose. Over time, this could overwork and damage the pancreas, causing it to produce less insulin. To combat this, avoid eating too many portions of refined carbs (e.g., white rice, white bread) and sugary foods. Another possible factor that causes insulin shortage is obesity and a fatty pancreas. Obesity causes fat to gather in the pancreas. The more fat in the pancreas, the less insulin it makes.

Diabetes can be diagnosed if a random (not done after fasting) blood glucose level is higher than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L).\n", "doc_id": "b84b1797-8b1d-4897-bee5-bf5bc31bd092", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "9494328ea2207d3b9a89a85f2a0bb7efc0134771515d4b607c2223bb9fc31a6b", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 587}, "relationships": {"1": "40e73598-c97c-4e7e-89ec-dd300093f440"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "44a196b7-6e9d-4f86-ba60-c56c74fb7115": {"__data__": {"text": "question: What is hemoglobin A1c? \nanswer: Hemoglobin A1C (also called glycosylated or glycolated hemoglobin) is a protein in the blood which reflects the person's long-term trends in blood glucose levels rather than rapid changes. Hemoglobin is the red, oxygen-carrying substance in red blood cells. When blood is exposed to high blood glucose levels over a period of time, glucose attaches to the hemoglobin and forms glycosylated hemoglobin. The hemoglobin A1C level blood test is reported as the percentage of hemoglobin that is A1C. Measurements of hemoglobin A1C can be used to diagnose diabetes when testing is done by a certified laboratory (not by instruments used at home or in a doctor's office). People with a hemoglobin A1C level of 6.5% or more have diabetes. If the level is between 5.7 and 6.4, they have prediabetes and are at risk of developing diabetes. \n", "doc_id": "44a196b7-6e9d-4f86-ba60-c56c74fb7115", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "c5168577589434b639934791e9de2007dbf40c7e217f5065b316bddced01de88", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 874}, "relationships": {"1": "223e83f6-e708-49a4-924c-914d99cd1d7a"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "adc882c6-ac33-4e13-9d4a-293c7024b9be": {"__data__": {"text": "question: What is an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT)?\nanswer: Another kind of blood test, an oral glucose tolerance test, may be done in certain situations, such as screening pregnant women for gestational diabetes or testing older people who have symptoms of diabetes but normal glucose levels when fasting.

Hypoglycemia is more common when intense efforts are made to keep the glucose levels in the blood as close to normal as possible, or when people who take insulin do not check blood glucose levels frequently enough. People with diabetes who reduce food intake or who develop chronic kidney disease are more likely to have hypoglycemia. Older people are more susceptible than younger people to hypoglycemia resulting from sulfonylurea medications.\nIf, after taking a dose of a medication for diabetes, a person eats less than usual or is more physically active than normal, the medication may lower the level of glucose in the blood too much. People who have had diabetes for a long time are particularly prone to hypoglycemia in these situations because they may not produce enough glucagon or epinephrine to counteract a low level of glucose in the blood.\n", "doc_id": "33b3d01a-9d4d-460a-99be-d49ba691490b", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "e4000353df5d7c22163e7001bfb36442c4b771cbdf369bde074f2e9ede6a9a2b", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1197}, "relationships": {"1": "b8b84dce-26b9-4971-b78d-c4329ee13161"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "e901b30f-abc8-40f8-bcf8-7993406254c6": {"__data__": {"text": "question: What are the symptoms of hypoglycemia?\nanswer: Hypoglycemia symptoms rarely develop until the level of glucose in the blood falls below 60 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L).

People with recurring episodes of hypoglycemia, especially those with diabetes, often prefer to carry glucose tablets because the tablets take effect quickly and provide a consistent amount of sugar. These people may benefit from consuming sugar followed by a food that provides longer-lasting carbohydrates (such as bread or crackers). When hypoglycemia is severe or prolonged and taking sugar by mouth is not possible, doctors quickly give glucose intravenously to prevent brain damage. People who are known to be at risk of episodes of severe hypoglycemia may keep glucagon on hand for emergencies. Glucagon administration stimulates the liver to release large amounts of glucose. It is given by injection or by a nasal inhaler and generally restores blood glucose to an adequate level within 5 to 15 minutes.

People with diabetes havea relatively higher glucose release from their liver, hence your glucose may be high even when you have not eaten anything. \n2. Your body may be producing stress hormones during an illness. Medications prescribed during illnesses (e.g. steroids) can also increase glucose levels. \n3.

There are several causes of blood vessel narrowing:\n- Complex sugar-based substances build up in the walls of small blood vessels, causing them to thicken and leak.\n- Poor control of blood glucose levels causes the levels of fatty substances in the blood to rise, resulting in atherosclerosis and decreased blood flow in the larger blood vessels.\nAtherosclerosis leads to heart attacks and strokes. Atherosclerosis is between 2 and 4 times more common and tends to occur at a younger age in people with diabetes than in people who do not have diabetes.

Sometimes, an infection is the first sign of diabetes.\nOne such infection is a yeast infection called candidiasis. Candida yeast is a normal resident of the mouth, digestive tract, and vagina that usually causes no harm. In people with diabetes, however, Candida can overgrow on mucous membranes and moist areas of the skin causing rashes in those areas.\nPeople with diabetes are also particularly likely to have ulcers and infections of the feet and legs because of poor circulation to the skin.

Pregnancy can cause diabetic retinopathy to worsen.\nRepeated exposure to high levels of sugar (glucose) in the blood make the walls of small blood vessels, including those in the retina, weaker and, therefore, more prone to damage.

Implants containing the corticosteroid fluocinolone are available in certain countries for people who have macular edema caused by diabetes. Relieving macular edema with drugs may improve vision. Other treatments include laser photocoagulation, in which a laser beam is aimed into the eye at the retina to slow the growth of abnormal new retinal blood vessels and decrease leakage. Laser photocoagulation may need to be repeated. If bleeding from damaged vessels has been extensive, a procedure called vitrectomy may be needed.

These steps include following an appropriate diet, exercising, and, if needed, taking insulin. High-sugar foods are eliminated from the diet, and women should eat so that they do not gain excess weight during pregnancy. Most pregnant women with diabetes are asked to measure their blood sugar level several times a day at home using a home blood sugar monitoring device. If blood sugar levels are high, women may need to take an oral hypoglycemic drug or insulin. Treatment sometimes causes blood sugar levels to decrease too much (called hypoglycemia). Hypoglycemia, if severe, causes confusion and loss of consciousness and can occur without any warning. If a woman is prone to episodes of hypoglycemia (for example, if she has had Type 1 diabetes for a long time), she is given a glucagon kit and taught how to use it. Glucagon, when injected, increases blood sugar levels. A family member is also taught how to use the kit. Then if symptoms of severe hypoglycemia occur, the woman or the family member can inject glucagon. Controlling diabetes is particularly important late in pregnancy because then, the blood sugar level tends to increase. A higher dose of insulin is usually needed.\nanswer:answer: Food labelled \u201ccholesterol-free\u201d does not mean that it does not contain fat. It only indicates that the food has been made with vegetable fat. Unsaturated fat is derived mainly from plants and can be monosaturated, as in olive and canola oil, or polyunsaturated, as in corn and peanut oil. Most non-dairy creamers, 2-in-1 and 3-in-1 beverages usually contain saturated vegetable fat (from palm oil and coconut products) and are not suitable for diabetics. It is best if you can avoid creamers, evaporated milk and full cream milk because they contain more saturated fat and calories than low-fat or skimmed milk. It is important to note that animal fat contains cholesterol (saturated fat). It may also be wise to limit your fat intake to 5g per serving in any type of food. Making healthy food choices is important for diabetics. It does not mean depriving yourself of certain types of foods, but you should consume in moderation. Choose foods that are vitamin and calcium enriched, whenever possible.\nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine\n", "doc_id": "04093c89-4c55-46d9-820e-9d43cfcc306a", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "7f9c6986cf688070d6c8f56f8fb82c2483012c2a303a2b09d7244e8bfa5fb7e7", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2494}, "relationships": {"1": "65fbf622-7f34-4f5e-aca3-020a808344b5"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "28959638-a3e9-4c65-ac4f-464d34c5467f": {"__data__": {"text": "question: What is so good about protein?\nanswer: Protein helps the body to repair skin tissues, bones and muscles.

The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your body is to the action of insulin which helps in moving glucose from your bloodstream into the cells to be used as energy. The more active you are the easier it is to control your weight as glucose is used up as energy when you exercise and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin.
