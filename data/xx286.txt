question: What causes diabetic ketoacidosis?
answer: Diabetic ketoacidosis is sometimes the first sign that people (usually children) have developed diabetes. In people who know they have diabetes, diabetic ketoacidosis can occur for two main reasons: 1) People stop taking their insulin; 2) An illness stresses the body. Rarely, some medications, especially the sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors, can cause diabetic ketoacidosis, even in people with type 2 diabetes. Some people with type 2 diabetes are also prone to develop ketoacidosis. This type of diabetes is called ketosis-prone diabetes, but is sometimes referred to as Flatbush diabetes. This type of diabetes is an unusual variant that is more likely to occur in people with obesity and in people of African ancestry.
