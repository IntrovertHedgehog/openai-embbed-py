question: Why is self-blood glucose monitoring important?
answer: It is important to do your own blood glucose monitoring to manage your diabetes effectively. Initially, you may need your familyâ€™s support, especially if you have a phobia of pricking yourself to get a drop of blood onto the test-strip. This type of monitoring is called home blood glucose monitoring (HBGM) or self blood glucose monitoring (SBGM). Diabetes is unlike other illnesses; besides taking medication, your daily living and quality of life are affected. It is important for you to take charge and be in control of your diabetes. Close monitoring of your blood glucose level will help you understand how your body reacts to medication, food and activities.
