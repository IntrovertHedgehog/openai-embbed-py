question: I have type 2 diabetes. What can I do to control my blood glucose better?
answer: Firstly, by knowing that you have limited amount of insulin, it would be better to have small to moderate amount of food. Next, a high fibre diet can prevent blood glucose spikes and allow more time for the insulin to work effectively. Lastly, exercise can enhance the action of insulin and allow more glucose to enter into the cells.
