question: What are the things I must do before pricking my finger?
answer: Before you prick your finger, remember to: 
1. Wash and clean dry your hands.
2. Check that your glucometer is in good working condition.
3. Change calibration code if you use new test strips. Your meter code must tally with the test strip code to ensure accuracy.
4. Check the expiry date of your test strip. Some individually wrapped test-strips can last longer.
5. Remember to close tight the container after taking a test-strip.
