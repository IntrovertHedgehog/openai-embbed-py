question: Why must I eat after injecting insulin?
answer: You must eat soon after each injection as it works faster and more effectively. It is important to have regular insulin injections and meals (at about the same time) to maintain a stable blood glucose level. It is advisable for people on insulin to have four to five small meals rather than two to three heavy meals a day. It is important to have a light snack such as a fruit or biscuits between lunch and dinner, especially if your dinner is more than 6 hours after lunch. This is also to synchronise your blood glucose level with the peak action of insulin to prevent hypoglycaemia, especially if you are on two types of insulin.
