question: What is the treatment for diabetic retinopathy?
answer: Treatment of diabetic retinopathy is aimed at controlling blood sugar and blood pressure. People with fluid buildup in the macula (macular edema) are given eye injections of certain drugs (for example, ranibizumab, bevacizumab, or aflibercept), which are called antiâ€“vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs. People may also be given injected corticosteroid implants, which slowly release constant levels of a corticosteroid into the eye. Implants containing the corticosteroid dexamethasone are useful for people who have persistent macular edema. Implants containing the corticosteroid fluocinolone are available in certain countries for people who have macular edema caused by diabetes. Relieving macular edema with drugs may improve vision. Other treatments include laser photocoagulation, in which a laser beam is aimed into the eye at the retina to slow the growth of abnormal new retinal blood vessels and decrease leakage. Laser photocoagulation may need to be repeated. If bleeding from damaged vessels has been extensive, a procedure called vitrectomy may be needed. In this procedure, blood is removed from the cavity in which the vitreous humor lies. Vision often improves after vitrectomy is done to treat vitreous hemorrhage, traction retinal detachment, or macular edema. Laser treatment only rarely improves vision, but it commonly prevents further deterioration.
