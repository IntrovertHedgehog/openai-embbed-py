question: How do I check if I am overweight by measuring waist circumference?
answer: Monitor your waist circumference as well as your weight. Compared to BMI, waist circumference is a better measure of body fat and is often used to assess cardiovascular risk. If your waist size is above 80cm for Asian women, and 90cm for Asian men, take care! This implies abdominal obesity. You can measure your waist circumference using a measuring tape. This is done close to the skin and ensuring that the tape is in between the lower ribs and navel. Measure during exhalation.
