question: What is Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus?
answer: People with type-2 diabetes make insulin, unlike those with type-1 diabetes. However, either their body does not recognize and use insulin properly, or their pancreas does not release enough insulin, which happens during the later stages of the disease. Consequently, type-2 diabetes may cause chronically high blood glucose levels, which can lead to several symptoms and potentially serious complications. If the body does not have enough insulin or the insulin isn’t used properly, glucose cannot enter the cells and instead builds up in the bloodstream. Many parts of the body can be damaged by this. Additionally, since the cells aren’t getting the glucose they need, they don’t function normally.
