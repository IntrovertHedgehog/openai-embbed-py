question: Why are diabetics more prone to hypoglycemia?
answer: Most cases of hypoglycemia occur in people with diabetes and are caused by insulin or other medications (especially, sulfonylureas, see Medication Treatment of Diabetes Mellitus: Oral Antihyperglycemic Medications) that they take to lower the levels of glucose in their blood. Hypoglycemia is more common when intense efforts are made to keep the glucose levels in the blood as close to normal as possible, or when people who take insulin do not check blood glucose levels frequently enough. People with diabetes who reduce food intake or who develop chronic kidney disease are more likely to have hypoglycemia. Older people are more susceptible than younger people to hypoglycemia resulting from sulfonylurea medications.
If, after taking a dose of a medication for diabetes, a person eats less than usual or is more physically active than normal, the medication may lower the level of glucose in the blood too much. People who have had diabetes for a long time are particularly prone to hypoglycemia in these situations because they may not produce enough glucagon or epinephrine to counteract a low level of glucose in the blood.
