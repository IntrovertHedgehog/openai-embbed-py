question: What is a healthy lifestyle?
answer: A healthy lifestyle is one that includes three regular, moderate meals a day, and an exercise programme of at least three days a week. In addition, limit alcohol intake, abstain from smoking and unhealthy snacking. Research has shown that regular, brisk walking can prevent and delay the onset of type 2 diabetes. On the other hand, watching television or playing on the computer for long hours increases the risk of diabetes. Please note that this is meant to be a general guide. Do consult your dietician for specific guidelines about your diet if you have diabetes, heart diseases or other health problems. For additional advice, please consult your doctor and other healthcare professionals.
