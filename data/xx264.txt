question: Can I only rely on diet control to manage my diabetes?
answer: If you have an underlying condition or heart disease, diet control itself is not enough. You may need tablets or insulin, or a combination of both insulin and tablets, to control your blood glucose, cholesterol and high blood pressure. You may even need medication to prevent kidney damage.
