question: I have mild diabetes, and I noticed that I am losing weight drastically. Is this a bad sign?
answer: A patientâ€™s treatment for mild diabetes is diet control. If you had three moderate meals a day, you should not have lost weight drastically. A gradual weight loss is expected with your change of diet and regular exercise. But if your drastic weight loss is coupled with high blood glucose, there are two possible factors to consider: 1) Many years of diabetes or poor control; and 2) Other illnesses e.g., cancer and pancreatitis.
