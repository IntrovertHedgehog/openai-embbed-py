question: What can life be like for a person with diabetes?
answer: People with type 1 diabetes must learn to estimate carbohydrates, balance their food intake with physical activities and adjust their insulin dose by monitoring their blood glucose levels using a glucometer at least four times a day. Most type 2 diabetics require oral medication, such as Sulphonylureas to be taken before meals to have better effects. ‘Starch blockers’ are usually taken together with food. Biguanides are to be taken after meals. Some people with type 2 diabetes may need to have basal injection at bedtime, or two to three times per day (depending on their condition and duration of diabetes).
