question: How is hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) treated?
answer: Hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) is treated much like diabetic ketoacidosis. Fluids and electrolytes must be administered and replaced intravenously (into the vein). Usually, people are given insulin intravenously so that it works quickly and the dose can be adjusted frequently. The level of glucose in the blood must be restored to normal gradually to avoid sudden shifts of fluid within the brain. The blood glucose level tends to be more easily controlled than in diabetic ketoacidosis, and blood acidity problems are not severe.
