question: What is so good about protein?
answer: Protein helps the body to repair skin tissues, bones and muscles. Fish, meat, eggs, beans and dairy products contain protein. Most protein-rich food have some fat as well. For example, eggs contain protein in the whites and fat in the yolks. Adults are advised to limit themselves to three eggs per week, regardless of the types of eggs. All types of nuts have protein and fat. Soya beans and soy products, which are also protein-rich, are recommended. Protein is a complex food, which is not easily digested, and should not be taken in large quantities. It is also not wise for diabetics to compromise by eating more protein as it can overload the kidneys. About two 3-ounce servings, about the size of a clenched fist of fish or lean meat, are recommended per day.
