question: How do I calculate my Body Mass Index (BMI)?
answer: This is the widely accepted method of categorising your weight, based on a formula derived from your height and weight. Body Mass Index or BMI is calculated as: weight (kg) / (height (m) x height (m)). A BMI of 18.5 â€“ 22.9 is considered healthy, whereas a result over 23 means your health is at risk. You are considered obese if you have a BMI of 30 and above.
