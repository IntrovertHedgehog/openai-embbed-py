question: How is diabetic ketoacidosis treated?
answer: Diabetic ketoacidosis is a medical emergency. Hospitalization, usually in an intensive care unit, may be necessary. Large amounts of fluids are given intravenously along with electrolytes, such as sodium, potassium, chloride, and sometimes phosphate, to replace those fluids and electrolytes lost through excessive urination. Insulin is generally given intravenously so that it works quickly and the dose can be adjusted frequently. Blood levels of glucose, ketones, and electrolytes are measured every few hours. Doctors also measure the blood’s acid level. Sometimes, additional treatments are needed to correct a high acid level. However, controlling the levels of glucose in the blood with insulin and, giving fluids, and replacing electrolytes usually allow the body to restore the normal acid-base balance.

answer:answer: Type-1 diabetes occurs when your immune system (body’s defense against infection) attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells (islet or langerhans) in your pancreas. Symptoms may not appear for months or years before the process begins. Some people have certain genes (pattern passed on from parent to child) that increase the likelihood of developing type-1 diabetes, though many will not develop type-1 diabetes despite having the genes. Type-1 diabetes may also be caused by being exposed to a trigger in the environment, such as a virus. Type-1 diabetes is not caused by diet or lifestyle habits.
