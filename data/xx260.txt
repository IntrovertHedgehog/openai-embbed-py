question: If I have to drink alcohol, what must I take note of?
answer: It is advisable to drink after a meal and not on an empty stomach, to prevent hypoglycaemia, low blood glucose reaction or unstable blood glucose. It may cause adverse reaction if taken with diabetes medicine, especially Metformin. It is important to limit to one drink, defined as a can of beer, about 360mls (12 ounces), or a glass of wine, 150mls (5 ounces) or a small glass of hard liquor (distilled spirit) about 45mls (1.5 ounces). You can exchange your fruit for a glass of red wine. Too much alcohol means too many calories, which is converted into fats (triglycerides) and can cause fatty liver.
