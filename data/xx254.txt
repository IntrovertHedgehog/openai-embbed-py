question: Why do I feel sleepy after a heavy lunch?
answer: When you have too much blood glucose in the body, your brain cannot work efficiently and you will feel lethargic. You cannot think properly and tend to forget easily. This can affect people with diabetes. Too much glucose in the blood can affect the absorption of vitamins and oxygen for the body systems to work efficiently. Remember, our red blood cells carry oxygen essential for every activity.
