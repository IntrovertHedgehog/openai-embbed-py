question: Why is it important to do blood glucose testing?
answer: Blood glucose fluctuates with our daily activities and the different types of food we eat. Regular exercise of at least 30 minutes can lower blood glucose. At the same time, stress and illness can cause blood glucose to rise. All these factors have to be taken into consideration when deciding on the insulin dosage. It is important to discuss this with your doctor and he may allow you to adjust your insulin dosage.
