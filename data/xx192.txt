question: How does exercising benefit diabetics?
answer: Exercise, in appropriate amounts (at least 150 minutes a week spread out over at least three days), can help people control their weight and improve blood glucose levels. Because blood glucose levels go down during exercise, people must be alert for symptoms of hypoglycemia. Some people need to eat a small snack during prolonged exercise, decrease their insulin dose, or both.
