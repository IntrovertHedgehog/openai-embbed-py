question: Can I prevent Type 2 diabetes?
answer: Type 2 diabetes can be prevented with lifestyle changes. People who are overweight and lose as little as 7 percent of their body weight and who increase physical activity (for example, walking 30 minutes per day) can decrease their risk of diabetes mellitus by more than 50%. Metformin, a medication that is used to treat diabetes, may reduce the risk of diabetes in people with impaired glucose regulation.
