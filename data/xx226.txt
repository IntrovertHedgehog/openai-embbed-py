question: What are the symptoms of hypoglycemia?
answer: Hypoglycemia symptoms rarely develop until the level of glucose in the blood falls below 60 mg/dL (3.3 mmol/L). Some people develop symptoms at slightly higher levels, especially when blood glucose levels fall quickly, and some do not develop symptoms until the glucose levels in their blood are much lower.
- Mild hypoglycemia: Sweating, nervousness, shaking, faintness, palpitations, and hunger
- Severe hypoglycemia: Dizziness, fatigue, weakness, headaches, inability to concentrate, confusion, slurred speech, blurred vision, seizures, and coma
The body first responds to a fall in the level of glucose in the blood by releasing epinephrine from the adrenal glands. Epinephrine is a hormone that stimulates the release of glucose from body stores but also causes symptoms similar to those of an anxiety attack: sweating, nervousness, shaking, faintness, palpitations, and hunger.
More severe hypoglycemia reduces the glucose supply to the brain, causing dizziness, fatigue, weakness, headaches, inability to concentrate, confusion, inappropriate behavior that can be mistaken for drunkenness, slurred speech, blurred vision, seizures, and coma. Severe and prolonged hypoglycemia may permanently damage the brain.
Symptoms can begin slowly or suddenly, progressing from mild discomfort to severe confusion or panic within minutes. Sometimes, people who have had diabetes for many years (especially if they have had frequent episodes of hypoglycemia) are no longer able to sense the early symptoms of hypoglycemia, and faintness or even coma may develop without any other warning.
