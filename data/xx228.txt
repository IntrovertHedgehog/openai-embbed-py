question: What can I do to avoid hypoglycemia?
answer: If a medication is causing hypoglycemia, the dose is adjusted or the medication is changed. People who do not have diabetes but are prone to hypoglycemia often can avoid episodes by eating frequent small meals rather than the usual three meals a day. Limiting intake of carbohydrates, especially simple sugars, is sometimes advocated to prevent hypoglycemia that occurs after a meal (called reactive hypoglycemia). Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, such as acarbose, which slow the absorption of carbohydrates, have also been used successfully in people with reactive hypoglycemia and post-bariatric surgery hypoglycemia.
