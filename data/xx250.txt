question: What are the risks of gestational diabetes?
answer: Early in pregnancy, poor control of diabetes increases the risk of the following:
- Having a baby with major birth defects
- Having a miscarriage
Late in pregnancy, poor control of diabetes increases the risk of the following:
- Having a baby that weighs more than 9 pounds at birth
- Developing preeclampsia (a type of high blood pressure that occurs during pregnancy)
- Having a baby whose shoulder gets caught in the birth canal (shoulder dystocia)
- Needing a cesarean delivery
- Having a stillborn baby
Babies born to women with diabetes tend to be larger than those born to women without diabetes. If diabetes is poorly controlled, babies may be particularly large. A large fetus is less likely to pass easily through the vagina and is more likely to be injured during vaginal delivery. Consequently, cesarean delivery may be necessary. Also, the fetusâ€™s lungs tend to mature slowly. Newborns of women with diabetes are at increased risk of having low sugar, low calcium, and high bilirubin levels in the blood (hyperbilirubinemia).
