question: Why do I experience ‘burning’ pain when I am passing urine?
answer: You may be having a urine tract infection. Urinary tract infection is very common among people with diabetes, because blood glucose is a good medium for germs to multiply. If recurrent, urine tract infections can lead to kidney problems. Therefore, it is important to consult a doctor and be treated early to prevent kidney complication. If the urinary tract infection is not treated properly, urine retention occurs and causes back-flow with germs spreading upward and thus damaging the kidney.

answer:answer: There are two types of diabetes mellitus, type 1 and type 2. In type 1 diabetes, the body produces almost no insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas that helps sugar (glucose) move from the blood into the cells. In type 2 diabetes, the body produces insulin, but cells fail to respond normally to the insulin. In both types of diabetes, the amount of sugar (glucose) in the blood is elevated.
