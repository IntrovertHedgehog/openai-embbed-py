question: Does diabetes lead to liver damage? 
answer: It is common for people with diabetes to also have fatty liver disease, in which abnormal fat deposits collect in the liver. Fatty liver disease can sometimes progress to more serious liver disease including cirrhosis. Doctors diagnose liver problems if liver blood tests are abnormal and confirm the diagnosis with a liver biopsy. Losing weight, maintaining good control of blood sugar levels, and treating high cholesterol can be helpful.
