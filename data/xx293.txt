question: What causes Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus?
answer: There are 2 primary causes of type-2 diabetes. The first cause is insulin resistance, where muscle, fat and liver cells become resistant to insulin. Insulin does not interact with these cells in a normal way, as such they donâ€™t take in enough sugar. The second cause is that blood sugar levels cannot be controlled by insulin produced by the pancreas. As a result, insufficient insulin is produced by the pancreas to control blood sugar levels.
