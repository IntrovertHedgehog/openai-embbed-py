question: Why is it important to have regular injections?
answer: Regular dosage ensures sufficient insulin in the body and prevents low blood sugar reaction, hypoglycaemia (too much insulin in the body). This can cause giddiness, fainting, “cold sweats” and shivers. Blood glucose levels, which are too low or too high, can damage the brain over a period of time. It can also affect vision and result in poor coordination. All these can be dangerous for drivers who are diabetic.
