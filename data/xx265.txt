question: Can diabetes be cured?
answer: Every person with diabetes, regardless of type 1 or type 2, must know that diabetes cannot be cured, but it can be controlled. Mild diabetes can be controlled with diet and regular exercise. This does not mean, however, that the person does not have diabetes. Mild diabetes, if poorly controlled, can worsen. With good control, you will feel your best and diabetes is less likely to damage your eyes, kidneys or nerves.
