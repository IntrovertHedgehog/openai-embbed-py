question: How many types of diabetic retinopathy are there?
answer: Diabetes mellitus can cause two types of changes in the eye. Nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy occurs first; then proliferative diabetic retinopathy occurs after and is more severe. In nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy, small blood vessels in the retina leak fluid or blood and may develop small bulges. Areas of the retina affected by leakage may swell, causing damage to parts of the field of vision. In proliferative diabetic retinopathy, damage to the retina stimulates the growth of new blood vessels. The new blood vessels grow abnormally, sometimes leading to bleeding (hemorrhage) or scarring. Extensive scarring may cause detachment of the retina.
