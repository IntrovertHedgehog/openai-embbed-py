question: What are common symptoms of diabetes?
answer: Symptoms of diabetes include: feeling very thirsty, needing to urinate more often than usual, blurred vision, feeling tired, and losing weight unintentionally. Over time, diabetes can damage blood vessels in the heart, eyes, kidneys and nerves.
Symptoms of type 2 diabetes can be mild. They may take several years to be noticed.  Symptoms may be similar to those of type 1 diabetes but are often less marked. As a result, the disease may be diagnosed several years after onset, after complications have already arisen.
