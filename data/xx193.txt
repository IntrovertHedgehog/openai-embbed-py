question: Why do I need to lose weight if I am obese?
answer: Many people, especially those with Type 2 diabetes, are overweight or obese. Some people with Type 2 diabetes may be able to avoid or delay the need to take medications by achieving and maintaining a healthy weight. Weight loss is also important in these people because excess weight contributes to complications of diabetes. When obese people with diabetes have trouble losing weight with diet and exercise alone, doctors may give weight-loss medication or recommend bariatric surgery (surgery to cause weight loss). Certain diabetes medications can induce weight loss, especially glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and SGLT2 inhibitor medications. Sometimes a doctor will recommend a medication that helps with weight loss.
