question: What is Waist â€“ Hip Ratio (WHR)?
answer: This tool determines body fat distribution. People with an excessive amount of fat over the waist, or an apple-shaped body have a higher risk of lifestyle diseases than those with a pear-shaped body, with more fat around the hips and thighs. WHR = Waist circumference (cm) / Hip circumference (cm). Normal WHR for women is less than 0.8, and for men is less than 1.0.
