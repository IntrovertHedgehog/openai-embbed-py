question: How do I quit cigarette smoking?
answer: If you are smoking twenty cigarettes a day, you can choose to quit with help from a smoking cessation clinic or on your own. If you decide to quit smoking, set a realistic goal and then stick to it. For example, you can reduce gradually by smoking one cigarette less per week. Inform your friends and family members about your plan and seek their support. Do not lose faith in yourself, even if those around you are sceptical. Be it alcohol or cigarettes, you have to take steps to reduce and quit eventually. Never mind if you decide to take ‘baby-steps’. What is important is that you have the will to change for the better.
