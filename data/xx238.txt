question: What can I do to prevent foot problems from developing?
answer: Foot care is critical. The feet should be protected from injury, and the skin should be kept moist with a good moisturiser. Shoes should fit properly and not cause areas of irritation. Shoes should have appropriate cushioning to spread out the pressure caused by standing. Going barefoot is ill advised. Regular care from a podiatrist (a doctor specialising in foot care), such as having toenails cut and calluses removed, may also be helpful. Also, sensation and blood flow to the feet should be regularly evaluated by doctors.
