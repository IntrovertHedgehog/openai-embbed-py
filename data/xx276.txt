question: How often should I monitor my blood glucose?
answer: If you are on OHA, it is recommended that you test at least twice a day, before medication and meals, and 2 hours after meals. Try to do it at different times of the day to monitor the blood glucose level, and your bodyâ€™s reaction to different types of food and activities. It is also to check the effectiveness of the medication. If you are on insulin, you need to check at least four times a day: particularly before injection and breakfast (FBG), lunch, dinner, and at bedtime. Do discuss with your doctor.
