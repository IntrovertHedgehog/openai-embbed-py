question: Can I take oral hypoglycaemic agents (OHA) if I am pregnant or planning to conceive?
answer: Most OHAs are not tested on pregnant women. Therefore, it is important for you to inform your doctor if you are planning to conceive. You may need to have insulin injection. During early pregnancy when the unborn baby (foetus) is growing and developing, it may not be safe to continue with OHA.
