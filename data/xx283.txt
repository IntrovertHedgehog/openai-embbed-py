question: How is hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) diagnosed?
answer: Doctors suspect the diagnosis of hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS) when people who have recently developed confusion are found to have a very high blood glucose level. They confirm the diagnosis by doing additional blood tests that show very concentrated blood and low ketones or acidity in the bloodstream.
