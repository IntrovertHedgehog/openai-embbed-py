An important step to effective manage diabetes nutrition is to keep track of the amount of carbohydrates you consume by using carbohydrates counting techniques.

Our body knows that glucose is a good product, and the kidneys act as filters to reabsorb the glucose into our blood by coating the red blood cells and transferring them to the muscle and liver to be stored as glycogen. When the liver, the main store, is full, excess glucose will be stored as triglycerides in the fat tissues. When our body needs energy, the stored glucose and glycogen in the liver will be broken down by insulin and converted to energy.\\nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine.\\n...</td>\n",

Some patients with mild Type 2 diabetes can achieve their target blood glucose levels with diet and exercise alone, but most Type 2 diabetics will eventually require oral medications to control their blood sugar levels, and possibly insulin injection in the later stage of the disease. The basic treatment strategy for all types of diabetes is to maintain good control over the amount of glucose in your blood, eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly, and watch your weight.

However, it is important that you understand how different foods affect your blood glucose levels, especially carbohydrates, since it the nutrient that has the greatest effect on your blood glucose levels. An important step to effective manage diabetes nutrition is to keep track of the amount of carbohydrates you consume by using carbohydrates counting techniques. When choosing the types of carbohydrates, pick starchy carbohydrate such as rice, noodles, pasta, cereals and starchy vegetables such as potatoes as these carbs release glucose into the blood stream at a slower rate compared to sugars, thus promoting a more stable blood glucose level.\\nSource: Win Against Diabetes Booklet.\\n...</td>\n",

Some patients with mild Type 2 diabetes can achieve their target blood glucose levels with diet and exercise alone, but most Type 2 diabetics will eventually require oral medications to control their blood sugar levels, and possibly insulin injection in the later stage of the disease. The basic treatment strategy is to maintain good control over the amount of glucose in your blood, eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly, and watch your weight.

However, it is important that you understand how different foods affect your blood glucose levels, especially carbohydrates, since it the nutrient that has the greatest effect on your blood glucose levels. An important step to effective manage diabetes nutrition is to keep track of the amount of carbohydrates you consume by using carbohydrates counting techniques. When choosing the types of carbohydrates, pick starchy carbohydrate such as rice, noodles, pasta, cereals and starchy vegetables such as potatoes as these carbs release glucose into the blood stream at a slower rate compared to sugars, thus promoting a more stable blood glucose level.\\nSource: Win Against Diabetes Booklet.\\n...   \n",

       "2  question: Can we store glucose in our body?\\nanswer: Yes, glucose is stored as glycogen mainly in the liver, muscles, and fat tissues. Our body knows that glucose is a good product, and the kidneys act as filters to reabsorb the glucose into our blood by coating the red blood cells and transferring them to the muscle and liver to be stored as glycogen. When the liver, the main store, is full, excess glucose will be stored as triglycerides in the fat tissues. When our body needs energy, the stored glucose and glycogen in the liver will be broken down by insulin and converted to energy.\\nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine.\\n...                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

Some patients with mild Type 2 diabetes can achieve their target blood glucose levels with diet and exercise alone, but most Type 2 diabetics will eventually require oral medications to control their blood sugar levels, and possibly insulin injection in the later stage of the disease. The basic treatment strategy is to maintain good control over the amount of glucose in your blood, eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly, and watch your weight. These will prevent the onset of diabetes.   \n",

However, it is important that you understand how different foods affect your blood glucose levels, especially carbohydrates, since it the nutrient that has the greatest effect on your blood glucose levels. An important step to effective manage diabetes nutrition is to keep track of the amount of carbohydrates you consume by using carbohydrates counting techniques. When choosing the types of carbohydrates, pick starchy carbohydrate such as rice, noodles, pasta, cereals and starchy vegetables such as potatoes as these carbs release glucose into the blood stream at a slower rate compared to sugars, thus promoting a more stable blood glucose level.\\nSource: Win Against Diabetes Booklet.\\n...   \n",
       "2  question: Can we store glucose in our body?\\nanswer: Yes, glucose is stored as glycogen mainly in the liver, muscles, and fat tissues. Our body knows that glucose is a good product, and the kidneys act as filters to reabsorb the glucose into our blood by coating the red blood cells and transferring them to the muscle and liver to be stored as glycogen. When the liver, the main store, is full, excess glucose will be stored as triglycerides in the fat tissues. When our body needs energy, the stored glucose and glycogen in the liver will be broken down by insulin and converted to energy.\\nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine.\\n...                                                                                                                                                                                 \n",

       "      <td>question: Does white rice cause diabetes?\\nanswer: Although recent studies by the Harvard School of Public Health and the National University Health System found that white rice has a high Glycaemic Index (GI), it is important to understand its overall health impact when taken as a part of our daily meals. GI ranks carbohydrates in food based on the rate at which they affect blood sugar levels. The important difference between sugar and rice is that sugar contributes calories with little nutritional benefit, while rice provides satiety and can be part of a healthy, balanced diet if accompanied by side dishes packed with nutritional value such as tofu, fish, lean meat, eggs and vegetables. In contrast, it is easy to eat too much sugar as it does not give the feeling of fullness and can lead to obesity, raising the risk of type 2 diabetes. Wholegrains like brown or red rice are better than white rice as these contain more nutrients like iron, magnesium, B vitamins and fibre. Wholegrains also take more time to digest, giving the feeling of fullness for longer. However, do note that any type of carbohydrates, including wholegrains, when taken in excess can still cause poor blood sugar control. Moderation is key.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>question: Do I need to follow a low carb diet?\\nanswer: People with diabetes do not need to go on a special diet. However, it is important that you understand how different foods affect your blood glucose levels, especially carbohydrates, since it the nutrient that has the greatest effect on your blood glucose levels. An important step to effective manage diabetes nutrition is to keep track of the amount of carbohydrates you consume by using carbohydrates counting techniques. When choosing the types of carbohydrates, pick starchy carbohydrate such as rice, noodles, pasta, cereals and starchy vegetables such as potatoes as these carbs release glucose into the blood stream at a slower rate compared to sugars, thus promoting a more stable blood glucose level.\\nSource: Win Against Diabetes Booklet.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>question: Can we store glucose in our body?\\nanswer: Yes, glucose is stored as glycogen mainly in the liver, muscles, and fat tissues. Our body knows that glucose is a good product, and the kidneys act as filters to reabsorb the glucose into our blood by coating the red blood cells and transferring them to the muscle and liver to be stored as glycogen. When the liver, the main store, is full, excess glucose will be stored as triglycerides in the fat tissues. When our body needs energy, the stored glucose and glycogen in the liver will be broken down by insulin and converted to energy.\\nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine.\\n</td>\n",

Tackle fatty foods by limiting intake of fried dishes and using less butter, ghee and coconut oil in cooking. Instead, opt for low fat cooking methods such as baking, boiling, grilling and steaming. To minimise salt intake, use less preserved food such as salted fish and canned meats, and more fresh products.

Some patients with mild Type 2 diabetes can achieve their target blood glucose levels with diet and exercise alone, but most Type 2 diabetics will eventually require oral medications to control their blood sugar levels, and possibly insulin injection in the later stage of the disease. The basic treatment strategy is to maintain good control over the amount of glucose in your blood, eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly, and watch your weight.

When choosing the types of carbohydrates, pick starchy carbohydrate such as rice, noodles, pasta, cereals and starchy vegetables such as potatoes as these carbs release glucose into the blood stream at a slower rate compared to sugars, thus promoting a more stable blood glucose level.\\nSource: Win Against Diabetes Booklet.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",
       "3   question: Can we store glucose in our body?\\nanswer: Yes, glucose is stored as glycogen mainly in the liver, muscles, and fat tissues. Our body knows that glucose is a good product, and the kidneys act as filters to reabsorb the glucose into our blood by coating the red blood cells and transferring them to the muscle and liver to be stored as glycogen. When the liver, the main store, is full, excess glucose will be stored as triglycerides in the fat tissues. When our body needs energy, the stored glucose and glycogen in the liver will be broken down by insulin and converted to energy.\\nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "15  question: How is diabetes treated?\\nanswer: Type 1 diabetes will require a regular dose of insulin, as prescribed by a doctor. Some patients with mild Type 2 diabetes can achieve their target blood glucose levels with diet and exercise alone, but most Type 2 diabetics will eventually require oral medications to control their blood sugar levels, and possibly insulin injection in the later stage of the disease. The basic treatment strategy is to maintain good control over the amount of glucose in your blood, eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly, and watch your weight. These will prevent the onset of diabetes.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

       "      <td>question: Does white rice cause diabetes?\\nanswer: Although recent studies by the Harvard School of Public Health and the National University Health System found that white rice has a high Glycaemic Index (GI), it is important to understand its overall health impact when taken as a part of our daily meals. GI ranks carbohydrates in food based on the rate at which they affect blood sugar levels. The important difference between sugar and rice is that sugar contributes calories with little nutritional benefit, while rice provides satiety and can be part of a healthy, balanced diet if accompanied by side dishes packed with nutritional value such as tofu, fish, lean meat, eggs and vegetables. In contrast, it is easy to eat too much sugar as it does not give the feeling of fullness and can lead to obesity, raising the risk of type 2 diabetes. Wholegrains like brown or red rice are better than white rice as these contain more nutrients like iron, magnesium, B vitamins and fibre. Wholegrains also take more time to digest, giving the feeling of fullness for longer. However, do note that any type of carbohydrates, including wholegrains, when taken in excess can still cause poor blood sugar control. Moderation is key.\\n</td>\n",

However, it is important that you understand how different foods affect your blood glucose levels, especially carbohydrates, since it the nutrient that has the greatest effect on your blood glucose levels. An important step to effective manage diabetes nutrition is to keep track of the amount of carbohydrates you consume by using carbohydrates counting techniques. When choosing the types of carbohydrates, pick starchy carbohydrate such as rice, noodles, pasta, cereals and starchy vegetables such as potatoes as these carbs release glucose into the blood stream at a slower rate compared to sugars, thus promoting a more stable blood glucose level.\\nSource: Win Against Diabetes Booklet.\\n</td>\n",

Some patients with mild Type 2 diabetes can achieve their target blood glucose levels with diet and exercise alone, but most Type 2 diabetics will eventually require oral medications to control their blood sugar levels, and possibly insulin injection in the later stage of the disease. The basic treatment strategy is to maintain good control over the amount of glucose in your blood, eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly, and watch your weight. These will prevent the onset of diabetes.\\n</td>\n",

       "1   question: Does white rice cause diabetes?\\nanswer: Although recent studies by the Harvard School of Public Health and the National University Health System found that white rice has a high Glycaemic Index (GI), it is important to understand its overall health impact when taken as a part of our daily meals. GI ranks carbohydrates in food based on the rate at which they affect blood sugar levels. The important difference between sugar and rice is that sugar contributes calories with little nutritional benefit, while rice provides satiety and can be part of a healthy, balanced diet if accompanied by side dishes packed with nutritional value such as tofu, fish, lean meat, eggs and vegetables. In contrast, it is easy to eat too much sugar as it does not give the feeling of fullness and can lead to obesity, raising the risk of type 2 diabetes. Wholegrains like brown or red rice are better than white rice as these contain more nutrients like iron, magnesium, B vitamins and fibre. Wholegrains also take more time to digest, giving the feeling of fullness for longer. However, do note that any type of carbohydrates, including wholegrains, when taken in excess can still cause poor blood sugar control. Moderation is key.\\n   \n",
       "2   question: Do I need to follow a low carb diet?\\nanswer: People with diabetes do not need to go on a special diet. However, it is important that you understand how different foods affect your blood glucose levels, especially carbohydrates, since it the nutrient that has the greatest effect on your blood glucose levels. An important step to effective manage diabetes nutrition is to keep track of the amount of carbohydrates you consume by using carbohydrates counting techniques. When choosing the types of carbohydrates, pick starchy carbohydrate such as rice, noodles, pasta, cereals and starchy vegetables such as potatoes as these carbs release glucose into the blood stream at a slower rate compared to sugars, thus promoting a more stable blood glucose level.\\nSource: Win Against Diabetes Booklet.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "6   question: What are some strategies I can use to have a well-balanced diet?\\nanswer: To consume less sugary foods, consider replacing sweetened beverages, sweets and cakes, with milk, fruit and wholemeal crackers. Tackle fatty foods by limiting intake of fried dishes and using less butter, ghee and coconut oil in cooking. Instead, opt for low fat cooking methods such as baking, boiling, grilling and steaming. To minimise salt intake, use less preserved food such as salted fish and canned meats, and more fresh products. Lastly, incorporate more high fibre foods by switching to unpolished brown rice, wholegrain cereals and brains, and including fresh fruit and vegetables.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         \n",

       "15  question: How is diabetes treated?\\nanswer: Type 1 diabetes will require a regular dose of insulin, as prescribed by a doctor. Some patients with mild Type 2 diabetes can achieve their target blood glucose levels with diet and exercise alone, but most Type 2 diabetics will eventually require oral medications to control their blood sugar levels, and possibly insulin injection in the later stage of the disease. The basic treatment strategy is to maintain good control over the amount of glucose in your blood, eat a balanced diet, exercise regularly, and watch your weight. These will prevent the onset of diabetes.\\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \n",
