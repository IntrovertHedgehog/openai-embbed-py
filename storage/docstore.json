A glucometer is small and can be used at home, in clinics and health centres to aid in diabetes detection. The blood glucose test is a similar finger-prick test to indicate blood glucose level at that point in time. It is convenient and can be accurate if done properly. Anyone, even a child, can be taught to perform the test and it is essential for a person with diabetes to operate the glucometer. Another way is to take the HbA1c (haemoglobin A1c) test, which reflects average blood glucose control for a three-month period. Haemoglobin A1c in the red blood cells (glycohemoglobin) are glycated or sugar coated. The body usually replaces red blood cells every three months. This is usually done quarterly in the laboratory. The blood glucose and HbA1c tests are not universally accepted as diagnostic tests for diabetes mellitus.

If blood glucose is not controlled over a period of time, neuropathy or permanent nerve damage may set in.\nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine.\n", "doc_id": "cd36ed55-ac13-4af3-b0d5-6b76b0acff25", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "338a25536fc12c9067d0b8e2685c374087a41c9c022e50a6b6fbbee30a2694d4", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 683}, "relationships": {"1": "97662a50-3c04-4227-a59c-992f234acfc8"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "70da7b52-8102-44d6-8b65-72ccdeb0b688": {"__data__": {"text": "question: What do kidneys do?\nanswer: Kidneys are the main excretory organs with millions of microscopic filtering units called nephrons.

Carbs and sugar get broken down into glucose. A high-carb, high-sugar diet means we need more insulin to process all that glucose. Over time, this could overwork and damage the pancreas, causing it to produce less insulin. To combat this, avoid eating too many portions of refined carbs (e.g., white rice, white bread) and sugary foods. Another possible factor that causes insulin shortage is obesity and a fatty pancreas. Obesity causes fat to gather in the pancreas. The more fat in the pancreas, the less insulin it makes.

Even during fasting periods, your liver releases stored glucose into your blood. People with diabetes havea relatively higher glucose release from their liver, hence your glucose may be high even when you have not eaten anything. \n2. Your body may be producing stress hormones during an illness. Medications prescribed during illnesses (e.g. steroids) can also increase glucose levels. \n3. Consumption of larger meals, that are high in carbohydrates and fat, at late hours can lead to higher post-meal blood glucose levels over an extended period of time.,Hence, it is advised to consume your last meal 3 hours before bedtime and try brisk walking for 30 minutes daily.

The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your body is to the action of insulin which helps in moving glucose from your bloodstream into the cells to be used as energy. The more active you are the easier it is to control your weight as glucose is used up as energy when you exercise and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin. A balanced diet consist of less sugar/sugary foods, less fat/fatty foods and less salt/salty foods. Include more high fibre foods by switching to unpolished brown rice, whole grain cereals and breads.

A glucometer is small and can be used at home, in clinics and health centres to aid in diabetes detection. The blood glucose test is a similar finger-prick test to indicate blood glucose level at that point in time. It is convenient and can be accurate if done properly. Anyone, even a child, can be taught to perform the test and it is essential for a person with diabetes to operate the glucometer. Another way is to take the HbA1c (haemoglobin A1c) test, which reflects average blood glucose control for a three-month period. Haemoglobin A1c in the red blood cells (glycohemoglobin) are glycated or sugar coated. The body usually replaces red blood cells every three months. This is usually done quarterly in the laboratory. The blood glucose and HbA1c tests are not universally accepted as diagnostic tests for diabetes mellitus.

This is possibly due to a defective gene factor. Initially, the pancreas may produce more insulin to cope with the increased blood glucose and to break down the food we eat. Usually, the patient needs anti-diabetic tablets or Oral Hypoglycaemic Agent (OHA) to control blood glucose. Eventually, the pancreas suffers a burnout and produces low levels of insulin.

A diet high in carbs, sugar, and fat increases calorie intake and contributes to obesity. Losing 5 to 10% of our body weight is enough to increase insulin sensitivity. Use My Healthy Plate or consult a dietician to guide you on how much to eat. Another cause of insulin resistance is lack of exercise. Do light workouts like walking and swimming to improve insulin insensitivity and help you lose excess weight. Insulin resistance may also be caused by factors like ethnicity, certain diseases, steroid use, some medications, older age, sleep problems, and smoking.\nSource: HealthHub\nhttps://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/diseases-and-conditions/676/pocket-guide-to-diabetes\n.\n", "doc_id": "ef86e342-671e-4c01-8525-07898d6724c4", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "85539250d2c81fbb28bb34b296e0b8a6b1439db9731abbd4e356ef82a8e0e622", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 822}, "relationships": {"1": "8e1b16ab-aa69-4bc2-ac51-5dde48354d20"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "a72c5b61-6998-411d-995f-1d90ff5d5f77": {"__data__": {"text": "question: What does insulin shortage mean?\nanswer: When there's a shortage of insulin, glucose cannot be transported into body cells effectively, leaving excess glucose in the bloodstream.\nSource: HealthHub\nhttps://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/diseases-and-conditions/676/pocket-guide-to-diabetes.\n", "doc_id": "a72c5b61-6998-411d-995f-1d90ff5d5f77", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "0300839fe9251c2d65d72ca863bf7a52b1a26dd705356fdb78730bfb2f85306c", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 290}, "relationships": {"1": "485332ef-f171-4bbe-a228-d2b14154e6ec"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "881a903f-1fca-40d4-8e51-ecdd44db0966": {"__data__": {"text": "question: What causes insulin shortage and what can I do about it?\nanswer: Insulin shortage can be caused your diet and an overworked pancreas. Carbs and sugar get broken down into glucose. A high-carb, high-sugar diet means we need more insulin to process all that glucose. Over time, this could overwork and damage the pancreas, causing it to produce less insulin. To combat this, avoid eating too many portions of refined carbs (e.g., white rice, white bread) and sugary foods. Another possible factor that causes insulin shortage is obesity and a fatty pancreas. Obesity causes fat to gather in the pancreas. The more fat in the pancreas, the less insulin it makes.

When blood is exposed to high blood glucose levels over a period of time, glucose attaches to the hemoglobin and forms glycosylated hemoglobin.

Measurements of hemoglobin A1C can be used to diagnose diabetes when testing is done by a certified laboratory (not by instruments used at home or in a doctor's office).

Most blood glucose monitoring devices (glucose meters) use a drop of blood obtained by pricking the tip of the finger with a small lancet. The lancet holds a tiny needle that can be poked into the finger or placed in a spring-loaded device that easily and quickly pierces the skin. Most people find that the pricking causes only minimal discomfort. Then, a drop of blood is placed on a reagent strip. The strip contains chemicals that undergo changes depending on the glucose level. The glucose meter reads the changes in the test strip and reports the result on a digital display.

The sensor measures blood glucose levels every few minutes. There are two types of CGMs, with different purposes:\n- Professional CGMs collect continuous blood glucose information over a period of time (72 hours to up to 14 days). Health care providers use this information to make treatment recommendations. Professional CGMs do not provide data to the person with diabetes.\n- Personal CGMs are used by the person and provide real-time blood glucose data on a small portable monitor or on a connected smartphone. Alarms on the CGM system can be set to sound when blood glucose levels drop too low or climb too high, so the device can help people quickly identify worrisome changes in blood glucose.\nCGMs can be worn for up to 14 days, often do not require calibration, and can be used for insulin dosing without fingerstick glucose confirmation. There are also systems in which the CGM device communicates with insulin pumps to either stop delivery of insulin when blood glucose is dropping (threshold suspend), or to give daily insulin (hybrid closed loop system).\n", "doc_id": "f448a461-8e19-43ca-9e6d-98b2331d108e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "6f943a39241f03e0979383ac4499f0ecb41a5843189665ee4f72ea2b4f55a33e", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1223}, "relationships": {"1": "394f1cd5-7bcf-4785-9d84-bce60df3cd96"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "190a32b4-99ee-4f17-90d3-d96bec2494a4": {"__data__": {"text": "question: Is CGM suitable for me?\nanswer: CGM systems are particularly helpful in certain circumstances, such as in people with type 1 diabetes who have frequent, rapid changes in blood glucose (particularly when the glucose levels sometimes go very low), which are difficult to identify with fingerstick testing.

Without treatment, diabetic ketoacidosis can progress to coma and death, sometimes very quickly.\nAfter type 1 diabetes has begun, some people have a long but temporary phase of near-normal glucose levels (honeymoon phase) due to partial recovery of insulin secretion.\n", "doc_id": "058a42c6-0c5b-42d0-b170-14c3baf1c01e", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "84cefc969c81df54105bf3d236bbb1d82475c7a888671bc4eea9ac69244e1e94", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 921}, "relationships": {"1": "d2d63acf-79b2-433e-b330-84b3e4ef0324"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "465be26e-0b33-4b63-ad9d-70e8a16a96ac": {"__data__": {"text": "question: How do the symptoms present in Type 2 diabetes?\nanswer: People with type 2 diabetes may not have any symptoms for years or decades before they are diagnosed. Symptoms may be subtle. Increased urination and thirst are mild at first and gradually worsen over weeks or months. Eventually, people feel extremely fatigued, are likely to develop blurred vision, and may become dehydrated. Sometimes during the early stages of diabetes, the blood glucose level is abnormally low at times, a condition called hypoglycemia. Because people with type 2 diabetes produce some insulin, ketoacidosis does not usually develop even when type 2 diabetes is untreated for a long time. Rarely, the blood glucose levels become extremely high (even exceeding 1,000 mg/dL [55.5 mmol/L]). Such high levels often happen as the result of some superimposed stress, such as an infection or medication use. When the blood glucose levels get very high, people may develop severe dehydration, which may lead to mental confusion, drowsiness, and seizures, a condition called hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state. Many people with type 2 diabetes are diagnosed by routine blood glucose testing before they develop such severely high blood glucose levels.\n", "doc_id": "465be26e-0b33-4b63-ad9d-70e8a16a96ac", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "02810d76dba2df7849b537875f0da0d607cc0947c47032e88673277122d5a2b4", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1229}, "relationships": {"1": "5f38d7c0-ae5e-4b31-bc33-17855128c5df"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "afef592d-1376-4914-a8a2-b201bfe75e71": {"__data__": {"text": "question: What is the ideal range for hemoglobin A1C level?\nanswer: People with diabetes aim for a hemoglobin A1C level of less than 7%.

These steps include following an appropriate diet, exercising, and, if needed, taking insulin. High-sugar foods are eliminated from the diet, and women should eat so that they do not gain excess weight during pregnancy. Most pregnant women with diabetes are asked to measure their blood sugar level several times a day at home using a home blood sugar monitoring device. If blood sugar levels are high, women may need to take an oral hypoglycemic drug or insulin. Treatment sometimes causes blood sugar levels to decrease too much (called hypoglycemia). Hypoglycemia, if severe, causes confusion and loss of consciousness and can occur without any warning. If a woman is prone to episodes of hypoglycemia (for example, if she has had Type 1 diabetes for a long time), she is given a glucagon kit and taught how to use it. Glucagon, when injected, increases blood sugar levels. A family member is also taught how to use the kit. Then if symptoms of severe hypoglycemia occur, the woman or the family member can inject glucagon. Controlling diabetes is particularly important late in pregnancy because then, the blood sugar level tends to increase. A higher dose of insulin is usually needed.\nanswer:answer: Food labelled \u201ccholesterol-free\u201d does not mean that it does not contain fat. It only indicates that the food has been made with vegetable fat. Unsaturated fat is derived mainly from plants and can be monosaturated, as in olive and canola oil, or polyunsaturated, as in corn and peanut oil. Most non-dairy creamers, 2-in-1 and 3-in-1 beverages usually contain saturated vegetable fat (from palm oil and coconut products) and are not suitable for diabetics. It is best if you can avoid creamers, evaporated milk and full cream milk because they contain more saturated fat and calories than low-fat or skimmed milk. It is important to note that animal fat contains cholesterol (saturated fat). It may also be wise to limit your fat intake to 5g per serving in any type of food. Making healthy food choices is important for diabetics. It does not mean depriving yourself of certain types of foods, but you should consume in moderation. Choose foods that are vitamin and calcium enriched, whenever possible.\nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine\n", "doc_id": "1bcce398-c75e-4e34-b7be-06bbc8cf8ade", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "7f9c6986cf688070d6c8f56f8fb82c2483012c2a303a2b09d7244e8bfa5fb7e7", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 2494}, "relationships": {"1": "3df159f0-3c49-4672-a983-749396d50e2e"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "4186d923-79f9-405e-9e61-a6f9fd5fb942": {"__data__": {"text": "question: What is so good about protein?\nanswer: Protein helps the body to repair skin tissues, bones and muscles.

About two 3-ounce servings, about the size of a clenched fist of fish or lean meat, are recommended per day.\nSource: Red Ants Crawling to My Urine\n", "doc_id": "4186d923-79f9-405e-9e61-a6f9fd5fb942", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "7d4c99738dd7eaaa2fea1a6056bd96c70a152285cc50ad24e600399828eeafdf", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 854}, "relationships": {"1": "34f69b02-64f7-42e4-a794-0b3544fae430"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "50b43c42-49ba-4e27-ac08-e1c2fd09ac63": {"__data__": {"text": "question: What is a healthy lifestyle?\nanswer: A healthy lifestyle is one that includes three regular, moderate meals a day, and an exercise programme of at least three days a week.

If the body does not have enough insulin or the insulin isn\u2019t used properly, glucose cannot enter the cells and instead builds up in the bloodstream. Many parts of the body can be damaged by this. Additionally, since the cells aren\u2019t getting the glucose they need, they don\u2019t function normally.\nSource: https://www.diabetes.org.sg/about-diabetes/causes-of-diabetes/\n", "doc_id": "d13e3082-4202-439a-8170-7ff29621d2f2", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "7d25bcb1e70bbcb79fb00183879b24f623e1c990277bac411833c31439dafe0b", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 825}, "relationships": {"1": "67d33525-3349-4d06-b862-b89dfe45145c"}}, "__type__": "1"}, "eed4a930-a1af-440c-b92c-c8822bbc855c": {"__data__": {"text": "question: What causes Type-2 Diabetes Mellitus?\nanswer: There are 2 primary causes of type-2 diabetes.

Cutting out carbohydrates completely is not recommended. A person who avoids carbohydrates completely is susceptible to low blood sugar levels and is likely to suffer from long-term deficiencies due to a lack of carbohydrate-containing food. In serious situations, hypoglycemia can result in diabetic comas that may be life-threatening, especially for those who are not consuming sufficient carbohydrates and are currently on diabetic medications. A balanced diet is essential for diabetes management. Eat more wholegrains instead of refined grains, and enjoy a variety of other carbohydrate-containing food, including low-fat yoghurt, fruits, beans and vegetables such as broccoli, carrots and sweet potatoes. It is advisable that carbohydrates form around 50 percent of the daily diet.

GI ranks carbohydrates in food based on the rate at which they affect blood sugar levels. The important difference between sugar and rice is that sugar contributes calories with little nutritional benefit, while rice provides satiety and can be part of a healthy, balanced diet if accompanied by side dishes packed with nutritional value such as tofu, fish, lean meat, eggs and vegetables. In contrast, it is easy to eat too much sugar as it does not give the feeling of fullness and can lead to obesity, raising the risk of type 2 diabetes. Wholegrains like brown or red rice are better than white rice as these contain more nutrients like iron, magnesium, B vitamins and fibre. Wholegrains also take more time to digest, giving the feeling of fullness for longer. However, do note that any type of carbohydrates, including wholegrains, when taken in excess can still cause poor blood sugar control.

The more fatty tissue you have, the more resistant your body is to the action of insulin which helps in moving glucose from your bloodstream into the cells to be used as energy. The more active you are the easier it is to control your weight as glucose is used up as energy when you exercise and makes your cells more sensitive to insulin. A balanced diet consist of less sugar/sugary foods, less fat/fatty foods and less salt/salty foods. Include more high fibre foods by switching to unpolished brown rice, whole grain cereals and breads. Remember to include fresh fruits and vegetables.\nSource: Harvard School of Public Health & Win Against Diabetes Booklet\nhttps://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/disease-prevention/diabetes-prevention/preventing-diabetes-full-story/#:~:text=Beyond%20individual%20behavior,healthy%20diet%2C%20and%20not%20smoking..\n", "doc_id": "77636740-c3e7-4853-8c91-f1fc8e8a811b", "embedding": null, "doc_hash": "338c37f72388e2d557c00af5ce14c76c9aa06edd5954626402a1efa6c37f17cb", "extra_info": null, "node_info": {"start": 0, "end": 1047}, "relationships": {"1": "01db94a1-5f47-4f1a-b758-0a09c87649d9"}}, "__type__": "1"}}}
